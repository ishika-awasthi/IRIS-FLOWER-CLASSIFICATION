# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

A **Machine Learning project** that predicts the species of Iris flowers (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, *Virginica*) based on sepal and petal measurements.
Built using **Python** and **Scikit-learn**, this project demonstrates the complete ML workflow — data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 📘 Overview

The Iris dataset is one of the most popular beginner datasets in ML.
This project focuses on:

* Exploring and visualizing data
* Building classification models
* Comparing algorithm performance

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* **IDE/Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of 150 samples with 4 features:

* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width

and a target variable:

* Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

You can load it using:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
data = load_iris()
```

## ⚙️ Model Implementation

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   Cleaned and normalized feature data.
2. **Visualization:**
   Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for correlation heatmaps and pair plots.
3. **Model Training:**
   Trained multiple models – Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and KNN.
4. **Evaluation:**
   Compared models using accuracy scores and confusion matrix.
